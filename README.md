## Description
This was the 10th challenge for the UW Coding bootcamp.  For this challenge, we had to follow acceptance criteria to generate an HTML file that contains 
information from user input. This project uses the Inquirer package for user prompts and Jest for testing. Bootstrap was used for the HTML cards and CSS styling.
